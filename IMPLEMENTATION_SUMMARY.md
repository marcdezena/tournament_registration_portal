## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
mysql -u root -p tournament_db < backend/database/setup_roles.sql
```

Or use phpMyAdmin to import `backend/database/setup_roles.sql`

### 2. Create Your First Admin
```sql
-- After registering your first user through the app:
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id) VALUES (1, 1);
```

### 3. Test the System
1. Register new users (auto-assigned Player role)
2. Login and check JWT token in localStorage
3. Request Organizer role as a player
4. Login as admin and approve requests
5. Access admin panel at `frontend/app/views/pages/admin/role-management.php`

## 🎯 Key Features

### Default Role Assignment
- ✅ All new users automatically get "Player" role (role_id: 2)
- ✅ Players can request "Organizer" role upgrade
- ✅ Admin approval required for Organizer role
- ✅ Admins can manually assign/remove any role

### JWT Authentication
- ✅ Secure token-based authentication
- ✅ 24-hour token expiry (configurable)
- ✅ Token stored in localStorage
- ✅ Server-side session validation
- ✅ Automatic token verification on API calls

### Role-Level Access Control
- ✅ Three roles: Admin, Player, Organizer
- ✅ Middleware protection for API endpoints
- ✅ Frontend role checking and UI toggling
- ✅ HTML attribute-based visibility (`data-role`, `data-roles`)

### Admin Features
- ✅ View all pending role requests
- ✅ Approve/reject organizer requests
- ✅ Manually assign roles to users
- ✅ Remove roles from users
- ✅ View all users with their roles
- ✅ Search and filter users

## 🔒 Security Features

### Implemented
✅ JWT token authentication  
✅ Server-side session validation  
✅ Password hashing (BCRYPT)  
✅ SQL injection protection (PDO)  
✅ Input sanitization  
✅ Role-based authorization  
✅ Token expiration  
✅ Session tracking (IP, user agent)

### Production Recommendations
🔐 Use HTTPS only  
🔐 HTTP-only cookies for tokens  
🔐 CSRF protection  
🔐 Rate limiting  
🔐 Change JWT secret key  
🔐 Environment variables for config  
🔐 Proper CORS configuration

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### Frontend Role Checking
```javascript
import { hasRole, isAdmin } from './core/auth.js';

if (isAdmin()) {
    // Show admin features
}

if (hasRole('Organizer')) {
    // Show organizer features  
}
```

### HTML Role-Based Visibility
```html
<!-- Admin only -->
<div data-role="Admin">
  <button>Delete User</button>
</div>

<!-- Admin or Organizer -->
<div data-roles="Admin,Organizer">
  <button>Create Tournament</button>
</div>
```

### Backend Endpoint Protection
```php
require_once '../middleware/auth_middleware.php';

$authMiddleware = getAuthMiddleware();

// Require admin role
$user = $authMiddleware->requireRole('Admin');

// Require organizer or admin
$user = $authMiddleware->requireRole(['Organizer', 'Admin']);
```

### Request Organizer Role
```javascript
import { requestOrganizerRole } from './core/auth.js';

await requestOrganizerRole("I want to organize tournaments for my community");
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Roles
| ID | Role Name | Description |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| 1  | Admin     | Administrator with full access |
| 2  | Player    | Regular player |
| 3  | Organizer | Tournament organizer |

### User Role Assignment Flow
1. User registers → Auto-assigned Player role (id: 2)
2. User requests Organizer role → Creates pending request
3. Admin reviews request → Approves or rejects
4. If approved → Organizer role (id: 3) assigned to user

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Users Setup
```sql
-- User 1: Admin + Organizer
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id) VALUES (1, 1), (1, 3);

-- User 2: Player only (default)
-- No additional INSERT needed

-- User 3: Organizer only
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id) VALUES (3, 3);
```
