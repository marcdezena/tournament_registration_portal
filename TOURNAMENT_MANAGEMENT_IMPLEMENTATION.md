# Tournament Management Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
After Organizers create a tournament, they should be able to manage that tournament and its details, such as viewing teams and players registering for the tournament where they will be able to reject, approve them, etc., and any other necessary features.

## Solution Overview
Implemented a comprehensive tournament management system for organizers with full participant and team management capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend API Endpoints (tournament_api.php)

#### New GET Endpoints

**organized-tournaments**
- **Purpose:** Get all tournaments created by the current organizer
- **Authorization:** Organizer or Admin role required
- **Returns:** List of tournaments with participant statistics (confirmed, pending, rejected counts)
- **Features:**
  - Groups participants by status for quick overview
  - Includes max participant limit information
  - Orders by creation date

**tournament-participants**
- **Purpose:** Get all participants for a specific tournament
- **Authorization:** Organizer or Admin role required + ownership verification
- **Returns:** Detailed participant information including:
  - User details (username, email)
  - Registration status
  - Registration notes
  - Team affiliation (for team-based tournaments)
- **Security:** Verifies user owns the tournament or is Admin

**tournament-teams**
- **Purpose:** Get all teams for team-based tournaments
- **Authorization:** Organizer or Admin role required + ownership verification
- **Returns:** Team information including:
  - Team name and tag
  - Captain name
  - Member count
  - Team status

#### New POST Endpoints

**approve-participant**
- **Purpose:** Approve a pending participant registration
- **Authorization:** Organizer or Admin role required + ownership verification
- **Validations:**
  - Checks tournament capacity before approval
  - Verifies participant exists and is pending
  - Updates registration_status to 'confirmed'
- **Side Effects:** Triggers update participant count automatically

**reject-participant**
- **Purpose:** Reject a pending participant registration
- **Authorization:** Organizer or Admin role required + ownership verification
- **Validations:**
  - Verifies participant exists
  - Updates registration_status to 'rejected'

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### New Page: manage-tournaments.php

**Features:**
- Displays all tournaments created by the organizer
- Shows real-time statistics for each tournament:
  - Confirmed participant count (green)
  - Pending registrations (yellow)
  - Rejected applications (red)
  - Max participant limit
- Tournament cards with action buttons
- Modal interfaces for detailed management

**User Interface Components:**
1. **Loading State:** Animated spinner while fetching data
2. **Empty State:** Helpful message when no tournaments exist
3. **Tournament Cards:** Visual cards displaying tournament info and stats
4. **Participants Modal:** Full-featured modal for participant management
5. **Toast Notifications:** Modern, non-intrusive feedback system

#### Updated Files

**tournament.js**
- Added `getOrganizedTournaments()` method
- Added `getTournamentParticipants(tournamentId)` method
- Added `getTournamentTeams(tournamentId)` method
- Added `approveParticipant(participantId)` method
- Added `rejectParticipant(participantId)` method

**index.php**
- Added "Manage Tournaments" navigation link
- Configured role-based visibility (Organizer, Admin only)

**home.js**
- Added event listener for manage-tournaments navigation
- Applied role-based visibility on page load

### 3. User Experience Enhancements

#### Modern Notification System
Replaced all `alert()` calls with a custom toast notification system:
- **Success notifications:** Green background, checkmark icon
- **Error notifications:** Red background, X icon
- **Auto-dismiss:** 3-second timeout
- **Smooth animations:** Slide-in effect
- **Consistent styling:** Matches dark neon theme

#### Participant Management Flow
1. Organizer clicks "Manage Participants" on tournament card
2. Modal opens showing all participants with their status
3. For pending participants:
   - Approve button (green) - Approves registration
   - Reject button (red) - Rejects registration
4. Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental actions
5. Toast notifications confirm success/failure
6. Lists automatically refresh after action

### 4. Security Implementation

#### Authorization
- **JWT Token Validation:** All endpoints require valid authentication token
- **Role Verification:** Organizer or Admin role required for all management actions
- **Ownership Verification:** User must own tournament or be Admin
- **Error Handling:** Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

#### Data Protection
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** All queries use prepared statements with parameter binding
- **XSS Prevention:** All user data escaped with `escapeHtml()` before rendering
- **Input Validation:** Server-side validation of all input parameters
- **Proper Error Messages:** No sensitive information leaked in errors

### 5. Database Integration

#### Tables Used
- `tournaments` - Tournament data with organizer_id
- `tournament_participants` - Participant registrations with status
- `tournament_teams` - Team information
- `tournament_team_members` - Team member relationships
- `users` - User information

#### Triggers
Existing triggers automatically handle:
- Participant count updates when status changes
- Activity logging for status changes

### 6. Quality Assurance

#### Testing
- Created validation test script (`test-tournament-management.php`)
- All tests pass successfully:
  - ✓ Backend endpoints implemented
  - ✓ Frontend API client updated
  - ✓ Management page created
  - ✓ Navigation integration complete
  - ✓ All features functional

#### Code Review
- Addressed all feedback from code review
- Improved user feedback system
- Maintained code consistency

#### Security Scan
- CodeQL scan completed
- No vulnerabilities found
- All security best practices followed

### 7. Documentation

#### Created Documents
1. **ORGANIZER_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive guide for organizers
   - Feature overview
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - API documentation
   - Security information
