    }
  ]
}
```

## Security

### Authorization
All tournament management endpoints require:
- Valid JWT authentication token
- Organizer or Admin role
- Tournament ownership verification (organizer must own the tournament)

### Ownership Verification
Before any management action:
1. User's authentication is verified
2. User's role is checked (Organizer or Admin)
3. Tournament ownership is verified (organizer_id matches user_id OR user is Admin)

### SQL Injection Protection
All database queries use prepared statements with parameter binding.

### XSS Protection
All user-provided data is escaped before rendering in HTML.

## Frontend Implementation

### JavaScript API Client
The `TournamentAPI` object in `tournament.js` provides methods:

```javascript
// Get organized tournaments
const result = await TournamentAPI.getOrganizedTournaments();

// Get participants
const result = await TournamentAPI.getTournamentParticipants(tournamentId);

// Get teams
const result = await TournamentAPI.getTournamentTeams(tournamentId);

// Approve participant
const result = await TournamentAPI.approveParticipant(participantId);

// Reject participant
const result = await TournamentAPI.rejectParticipant(participantId);
```

### User Notifications
Modern toast notifications replace traditional alerts:
- Success notifications (green)
- Error notifications (red)
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds

## Database Schema

### Relevant Tables

**tournament_participants:**
- `id` - Participant record ID
- `tournament_id` - Tournament reference
- `user_id` - User reference
- `registration_status` - pending, confirmed, rejected, withdrawn, waitlist
- `registration_notes` - Optional notes from participant
- `registered_at` - Registration timestamp

**tournaments:**
- `organizer_id` - References the user who created the tournament
- `max_participants` - Maximum number of participants
- `current_participants` - Current confirmed count (auto-updated via triggers)

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Approve Participant
**Error:** "Tournament is full"
**Solution:** Increase `max_participants` or reject other pending participants first

### Cannot See Participants
**Error:** "You do not have permission"
**Solution:** Verify you are the tournament organizer or have Admin role

### Participant Not Listed
**Possible Causes:**
- Participant hasn't registered yet
- Participant withdrew their registration
- Check the registration status filter

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- Bulk approve/reject actions
- Participant messaging system
- Registration status change notifications
- Participant search and filtering
- Export participant list
- Registration deadline management
- Waitlist management
